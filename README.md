#What should I call my Bro?

Sometimes you have a lot of bros, and you run out of names for them all. This app should help.

It parses an xml dump of wiktionary.org to and generates a bunch of things to call a bro. 

Visit [the GitHub page for this project](http://ajalt.github.io/whatshouldicallmybro/) to check out the results.
